# How to Build a First-Call Script from Scratch

## 1. Set One Hard Objective

First call only qualifies and secures the next calendar event, normally a PoC or deep technical session.

## 2. Pick Your Skeleton

- **SPICED for discovery**: Situation, Pain, Impact, Critical Event, Decision.
- **A trimmed MEDDPICC for fast qualify**: Metrics, Economic buyer, Decision process, Paper process, Pain, Champion, Competition.
- **Buyer-enablement mindset**: give the prospect everything they need to sell the deal internally.

## 3. Allocate the 15-20 Min Window

- **Icebreaker and agenda** – 2 min.
- **Context injection** – 1 min.
- **Discovery (SPICED)** – about 7 min.
- **Micro-pitch** – about 3 min.
- **Next step and commitment** – 2 min.
- **Wrap-up** – 2 min.

Aim for ⅓ seller talk, ⅔ prospect talk.

## 4. Write the Script Top-Down

- **Agenda line**: "Goal today – confirm context, surface priorities, decide if a PoC makes sense. Good?"
- **Context injection**: cite a public fact about their business to prove preparation and open the floor.
- **SPICED question bank**: prep 2-3 per letter, ask only what matters.
- On the fly, mark the MEDDPICC items you hear. No Pain or no deadline – politely park the lead.
- **Micro-pitch**: one value statement, two-three numbers, one short proof case.
- **Next step**: propose the PoC, set date and time, get verbal yes.
- **Wrap-up**: promise one-pager, give support contact, end the call.

## 5. Language and Pace Rules

- Short sentences, no fluff.
- End every block with a question or check-in to keep control.
- Keep your side under forty percent of words.

## 6. Draft Formula You Can Clone

1. "Hi [Name], will keep us to 20 min."
2. "Plan – verify context, understand priorities, agree on PoC."
3. "Saw your recent 5 Gbps spike in LatAm traffic, correct me if that's off."
4. SPICED questions.
5. "We run 130 PoPs, 28 ms average RTT in LatAm, and usually cut opex 20-30 percent for companies like yours."
6. "I spin up a test on your domain Tuesday 9 am PT, we review data Wednesday 9 am PT. Work for you?"
7. "I'll email the one-pager and NOC contact."

## 7. When to Generate a New Script

- **New product or new ICP** means you rewrite three pieces: the context injection, the discovery questions, and the micro-pitch numbers and case.
- The core structure stays the same, minimizing ramp-up time for any seller.

## 8-Step Scenario Creation Process

To create this scenario, you will follow this structured process:

### Step 0: Initial Data Load
- **Input**: Company description and available products (from pre-grading)
- **Output**: Foundation data loaded into conversation history
- **Purpose**: Establish the baseline information that drives all subsequent analysis

### Step 1: Company Snapshot
- **Input**: Pre-loaded company data + public research
- **Output**: Complete business profile with metrics and context
- **Purpose**: Understand the organization's current state and strategic position

### Step 2: Tech Stack & Performance Baselines
- **Input**: Company snapshot + technical research
- **Output**: Current infrastructure and performance analysis
- **Purpose**: Identify technical requirements and performance gaps

### Step 3: Performance Baseline Report
- **Input**: Tech stack analysis + public performance data
- **Output**: Quantified performance metrics and incident history
- **Purpose**: Establish current performance baselines for comparison

### Step 4: Quantified Business Plan
- **Input**: All previous analysis + financial research
- **Output**: ROI projections and business impact calculations
- **Purpose**: Create financial justification for proposed solutions

### Step 5: Stakeholders & Buying Process
- **Input**: Company analysis + organizational research
- **Output**: Decision-maker mapping and procurement workflow
- **Purpose**: Understand who influences the purchase and how decisions are made

### Step 6: Product Solution Mapping
- **Input**: Available products (Step 0) + prospect analysis (Steps 1-5)
- **Output**: Product-problem fit assessment and prioritization
- **Purpose**: Connect available products to specific client needs and stakeholders

### Step 7: Value Map
- **Input**: All previous steps + solution mapping
- **Output**: Final value proposition linking pains to solutions
- **Purpose**: Create the compelling narrative for the sales conversation

## Process Flow

1. **Start with Step 0** - Load your initial company description and available products
2. **Execute Steps 1-7 sequentially** - Each step builds on the previous analysis
3. **LangChain Integration** - All data persists throughout the conversation
4. **Final Output** - Complete first-call preparation with quantified value proposition

This process ensures you walk into the first call with deep context, appropriate product recommendations, and a clear value narrative tailored to the specific prospect.
