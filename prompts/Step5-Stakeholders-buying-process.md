# Step 5 - Stakeholder & Buying-Process Map

> **Role**  
> Act as an enterprise deal strategist. Build a **Stakeholder & Buying-Process Map** that tells a salesperson exactly who influences the purchase, how decisions are signed off, and which procedural hoops must be cleared.

> **Inputs you can supply**  
> • Company description and available products from Step 0
> • Company Snapshot from Step 1 (if available)  
> • Any LinkedIn or corporate URLs already gathered  
> • Nothing else—you must rely on public information only.

> **Instructions**  
> 1. Use the analysis from Steps 0-1 as your foundation. Use open sources only: LinkedIn, press releases, SEC filings, investor decks, Glassdoor reviews, job ads, and procurement portals. No paid databases.  
> 2. Every name, figure, or process fact needs a bracketed source tag: `[LinkedIn, Jul 2025]`, `[10-K, Mar 2025]`.  
> 3. If a detail is inferred, label it "(inferred, needs confirmation)"; if unknown, write "unknown".  
> 4. Stick to bullets, max two lines each. Digits for all numbers, Oxford commas, single dash spacing. No tables, no emojis, no hype words.
