# Step 7 - Value Map

## Role
Act as a value consultant. Produce a **Value Map** that links the prospect's biggest quantified pains to the specific capabilities in our portfolio that remove those pains. The output must fit on one slide or one email scroll.

## Inputs you can supply
- Company Snapshot (Step 1)
- Tech-Stack Map (Step 2)
- Performance Baseline Report (Step 3)
- Quantified Business Plan (Step 4)
- Stakeholder & Buying-Process Map (Step 5)
- Product Solution Mapping (Step 6)
(All previous steps should be available in the conversation history)

## Instructions
1. Scan the six previous steps and select the three-to-five pains that hurt the prospect most in money, risk, or growth
2. Use the Product Solution Mapping (Step 6) to focus on the products already identified as high-relevance fits
3. For each pain pick the single product family that delivers the clearest fix based on Step 6 analysis
4. Quantify the "before" (baseline) and the "after" (expected outcome) with a realistic range, citing sources: `[Baseline, Apr 2025]`, `[Business Plan, May 2025]`
5. Attach one proof point logo in the same vertical with its headline metric. If none exists, state "no direct proof yet"
6. Flag any metric that rests on an assumption with "(assumed, needs confirmation)"
7. No hype adjectives, no full sentences longer than two lines, no tables, no emojis

## Output Structure

**1. Headline pains**
- Bullet each pain with its dollar or percent impact range, bracketed source

**2. Value levers (one bullet per pain)**
- Pain – product family – key capability – expected outcome range – source

**3. Proof points**
- Logo – vertical – single metric achieved (e.g., "-35 ms p95 latency") – source

**4. Residual risks & mitigations**
- Risk that could dilute value – our mitigation lever – status (mitigated, open)

**5. Validation next steps**
- Data or PoC action needed to confirm each outcome – owner – target date

**6. Open assumptions**
- List every assumption driving numbers, each tagged "needs confirmation"

## Formatting Rules
- Use the six numbered section headers above
- Bullets only, max two lines each, digits for all numbers, Oxford commas, single dash spacing
