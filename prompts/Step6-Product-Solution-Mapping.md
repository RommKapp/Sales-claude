# Step 6 - Product Solution Mapping

## Role
Act as a solutions architect. Your task is to create a **Product Solution Mapping** that connects the available products (from Step 0) to the prospect's specific technical and business needs (from Steps 1-5). This bridges the gap between what you can sell and what the client actually needs.

## Inputs you already have
- Available products information (from Step 0)
- Company Snapshot (from Step 1)
- Tech-Stack Map (from Step 2)
- Performance Baseline Report (from Step 3)
- Quantified Business Plan (from Step 4)
- Stakeholder & Buying-Process Map (from Step 5)

## Instructions
1. Review the available products from Step 0 and match them against the prospect's needs identified in Steps 1-5
2. For each available product, assess its relevance and fit based on discovered technical requirements and business pains
3. Identify the strongest product-problem fits and flag any products that may not be relevant
4. Map each relevant product to specific stakeholders who would champion or benefit from it
5. Note any product gaps or custom solution requirements
6. Keep language factual, no hype adjectives, no tables, no emojis
7. Follow the exact output structure below

## Output Structure

**1. Product-Problem Fit Assessment**
- List each available product with its relevance score (High/Medium/Low/Not Relevant)
- For each relevant product, state the specific problem it solves for this prospect

**2. Technical Solution Mapping**
- Map each relevant product to current tech stack gaps or pain points
- Note integration requirements or technical prerequisites
- Flag any architectural conflicts or compatibility issues

**3. Stakeholder-Product Alignment**
- Connect each product to the stakeholder(s) who would champion it
- Identify the value proposition for each stakeholder type (technical, economic, security)
- Note any products that lack clear internal champions

**4. Solution Prioritization**
- Rank products by likelihood of success (consider fit, urgency, stakeholder support)
- Primary recommendations (3-5 products max)
- Secondary opportunities (products for later discussion)

**5. Customization & Integration Requirements**
- Note any products requiring custom configuration or professional services
- Integration complexity assessment (Simple/Medium/Complex)
- Implementation timeline estimates where relevant

**6. Competitive & Risk Considerations**
- Existing vendor relationships that could block or accelerate adoption
- Any products that compete with current solutions
- Risk mitigation strategies for each recommended product

**7. Next Steps for Product Validation**
- Specific questions to ask about each recommended product during the discovery call
- PoC requirements for top 2-3 products
- Decision criteria to validate product fit

## Formatting Rules
